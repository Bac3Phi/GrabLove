# Community Guidelines
Welcome to the GrabLove community. If you’re honest, kind and respectful to others, you’ll always be welcome here. If you choose not to be, you may not last. Our goal is to allow users to express themselves freely as long as it doesn’t offend others. Everyone is held to the same standard on GrabLove. We’re asking you to be considerate, think before you act, and abide by our community guidelines both on and offline. Seriously, don’t make us Swipe Left on you—because there will be no do-overs once we do.
